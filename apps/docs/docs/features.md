## Store your Data Locally, Skip the Cloud

Your data is stored locally on device and can be accessed with no internet connection. Try it out! After syncing your medical records for the first time, try turning off your internet connection and refreshing the app. You'll still be able to see and search through all your data.

Mere focuses on making sure you own your data. You can back up, export, and delete your data at any time - its only stored on your device.

## Encrypt your Data

Mere optionally allows you to password protect your data. Mere uses your password to encrypt your data at rest. This means that even if someone were to get access to your device, they wouldn't be able to see your data without your password.
