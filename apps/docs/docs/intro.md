# What is Mari Medical?

How long would it take you to collect _all_ of your medical records from every doctor or hospital you've been to? For most people, it would take a long time. You'd need to log in to various patient portals, find paper copies of older records that still need to be digitized, and collect immunization records. Maybe you also have some medical imaging stored on CDs or USB drives. It's surprisingly hard to get all your records digitalized and in one place without a lot of manual curation.

Many hospitals have online patient portals, which is a helpful first step in making your records easy to access. Still, different health systems have different portals - each with different logins. Some private companies promise to make this task easier by collecting and managing your medical records across health systems for you - but can you trust them with your private health data?

Mari Medical is a self-hosted web application that allows users to collect and manage all their medical records in one place. It aims to make the process of getting all your records digitalized and organized easier, without the need for manual curation. Mari Medical is built on open standards like HL7 FHIR, and is free, open source, and self-hostable. It also supports offline access and multi-device syncing. While still in the early stages of development and currently requires a technical background to get up and running on your computer. We do offer a [1-click deployment to digital ocean](./getting-started/deploy-to-do.md) for those who prefer that option.
