# Installing Mere Medical as an App

While Mere Medical does not have an official app in an app store, you can install this website as an app directly on your iOS or Android device. You can also install the app on your desktop device if you use Google Chrome.

# iOS

:::danger

If you are using Mere on your iOS device, it is **important to install the PWA** app. Do not use Mere in the Safari browser, as Safari will delete all your data after 7 days.

:::

On your iOS device, open up safari to the [Mere App Web Page](https://app.meremedical.co). From there, the steps to add the Mere app to the home screen are:

1. Open the Share menu, available at the bottom or top of the browser.
2. Click Add to Home Screen.
3. Confirm the name of the app.
4. Click Add.

You should now see the Mere app on your home screen.

# Android

The prompt you might see on your Android device will differ depending on which device you use. You should see a prompt with text along the lines of **Install** or **Add to Home Screen**. Click the button and follow the instructions to install the Mere app to your home screen.

# Chrome

Go to the [Mere App Web Page](https://app.meremedical.co) and look at the URL bar in the top right. These browsers will show an install badge (icon) in the URL bar (see the image below), stating that the app is installable. See an example image below:
