    "howToImplement": "Assess risk. Risk factors for AAA include older age, male sex, smoking, and having a first-degree relative with an AAA. The recommendation varies based on a patient’s sex, age, and smoking history. “Ever smoker” is commonly defined as smoking 100 or more cigarettes. Screen. Abdominal duplex ultrasonography is the standard approach for AAA screening. Screen men aged 65 to 75 years who have ever smoked. Selectively offer screening to men aged 65 to 75 years who have never smoked. Evidence shows that the overall benefit for screening all men in this group is small. To determine whether this service is appropriate, patients and clinicians should consider the patient’s medical history, family history, other risk factors, and personal values. For those who screen positive, treatment of AAA will depend on aneurysm size, the risk of rupture, and the risk of operative mortality.",

The IGRA requires a single venous blood sample that measures the CD4 T-cell response to specific Mycobacterium tuberculosis antigens and laboratory processing within 8 to 30 hours after collection. Testing with IGRA may have advantages over TST for persons who have received a BCG vaccination, as IGRA does not cross-react with the vaccine, and for persons who may be unlikely to return for TST interpretation.",

    "description": "The USPSTF recommends that clinicians offer or refer adults with a body mass index (BMI) of 30 or higher (calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared) to intensive, multicomponent behavioral interventions.",
    "appliesTo": "Adults with a BMI of 30 or higher.",
    "howToImplement": "Effective intensive behavioral interventions were designed to help participants achieve or maintain a ≥5% weight loss through a combination of dietary changes and increased physical activity. Most interventions lasted for 1 to 2 years, and the majority had ≥12 sessions in the first year. Most behavioral interventions focused on problem solving to identify barriers, self-monitoring of weight, peer support, and relapse prevention. Interventions also provided tools to support weight loss or weight loss maintenance (eg, pedometers, food scales, or exercise videos)",
